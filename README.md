## How to use


* to search for a movie, input movie-this <"name of movie"> followed by the movie you want to search for. Don't be afraid to search for a movie with a long title!

* to search for a song on spotify, input spotify-this-song <"name of song"> followed by the name of the song you want to search for. You'll see a bunch of songs, so look towards the top of the list for the song you are *probably* looking for. If you'd like you can also include the artist's name to narrow the search.

* to search for a band or artist's concert schedule, input concert-this <"name of movie"> followed by the artist's name. If nothing appears but you get no errors, it likely means the artist has no tour dates currently scheduled.
